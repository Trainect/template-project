## Introduction

This is a project template to use as inspiration or as a starting point to create a repository for a real project.

## Adapt Template Project to Your Use Case

Once the new project repository has been created and downloaded locally, the fastest way to immediately get the right structure is to copy the contents of this project into the new project.

Done this, you can search and replace all the occurance of `Template Project`, `template_project` and `template-project` and replace them with what you want. For doing this, if you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (strongly suggested) you can go to `Edit` > `Replace in Files`.

You're almost ready to go, check all files carefully, rename folders, delete modules you don't need (in the `src/template_project` you will find a list of suggested module names, use them if possibile), change the requirements in `setup.py` and `src/requirments.txt` and ... update this README.

## Contributing Guidelines

One of the important parts of Template Project is its [CONTRIBUTING](https://bitbucket.springlab.enel.com/projects/cv/repos/template-project/browse/CONTRIBUTING.md) file, READ VERY CAREFULLY and keep it in your project.
